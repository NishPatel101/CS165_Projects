# CS165 Projects
This repository is for my work on the CS165 projects.  
  
## Project 2 - CTF
We exploited vulnerabilities in a toy application and a real-world application to bypass authentications. For the toy application, we modified instructions in the binary to bypass authentication and retrieve a success string (flag). For the real-world application, we similarly modified instructions in the binary to use the program after the trial period ends.
